## Introduction

This repository serves as a resource for learning Python programming concepts. The code examples provided here cover a 
wide range of topics, from basic data types and data structures to control flow, functions and modules. Each section is 
accompanied by code snippets and explanations to help you understand how these concepts work.

## Data Types

### Numbers

In this section, you'll find examples of how to work with numerical data in Python, including basic arithmetic operations 
and number manipulation.

### Strings

Explore the manipulation of text using strings. Learn about string concatenation, slicing, formatting, and other 
string-related operations.

### Booleans

Understand the Boolean data type and how it is used for logical operations and control flow in Python.

## Data Structures

### Lists

Learn about lists, a versatile and commonly used data structure in Python. Discover how to create, modify, and 
iterate through lists.

### Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists but with immutability. This section will cover how to create and use tuples effectively.

### Sets

Explore the concept of sets in Python, including their properties and how they can be used for tasks like membership 
testing and eliminating duplicates.

### Dictionaries

Dive into dictionaries, which allow you to store key-value pairs. Learn how to create dictionaries, add or retrieve 
elements, and iterate through them.

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

Understand how conditional statements such as `if`, `elif`, and `else` work in Python to make decisions based on different 
conditions.

### For Loops

Learn how to use `for` loops to iterate over sequences (like lists, tuples, or strings) and perform actions on each item.

### While Loops

Explore the concept of `while` loops, which execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is met.

## Functions

### Python Functions

Discover the power of functions in Python. Learn how to define functions, pass arguments, return values, and create 
reusable pieces of code.

### Decorators

Explore decorators, a powerful feature in Python that allows you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions without 
changing their code. Learn how to create and use decorators to add functionality to your functions.

### Generators

Dive into the world of generators, a memory-efficient way to create iterators in Python. Learn how to define generators 
using the `yield` keyword and how they can be used for lazy evaluation of sequences.

## Python Modules

Learn how to use and create Python modules, which are reusable files containing Python code(specifically functions). 
Modules help you organize your code and make it more modular.

## Python Packages

Explore the concept of Python packages, which allow you to organize related modules into a directory hierarchy. 
Packages help you manage larger projects and maintain code separation.

## Getting Started

To start exploring the code examples, simply navigate to the respective folders for each topic and browse through 
the code files. Each file contains comments and explanations to guide you through the concepts being demonstrated.

Feel free to clone or download this repository to your local machine and experiment with the code on your own. Make 
sure you have the required dependencies installed to run the code successfully.

## Dependencies

Before running the code examples in this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
